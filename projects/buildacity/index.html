</div></div><div class="project-container-main"><p class="project-subtitle">Project Overview</p><p>Build A City is an interactive game developed by Team Spark for the client, Thinkingbox. The goal was to create an Out-Of-Home (OOH) installation that focused on using new and exciting technology for a unique user experience. This entailed imagining the installation for a particular public space (such as mall, airport, comic-con event, etc.) and pitching it as an on-site activation for a client and/or idea of our choice.</p><p class="project-subtitle">The Idea</p><div class="quote">Bringing the nostalgia of block-stacking to an immersive mixed-reality experience. </div><p>The idea of the project was to create an interactive game that took real-world interactions of building with blocks and augment the experience to a virtual space. Each physical block represents a type of building which, when placed on a game board, appears as a virtual rendering of that building on screen. In this way, players can arrange blocks to create a city of their own. Players are encouraged to collaborate and build a sustainable city. After they submit their entry, they can view a 360 model of the city they just created and share it with others on social media.</p></div><div class="project-container-main"></div><div class="project-container-flex">   <div class="project-container-flex-smaller"><img src="iphone-black.png" class="full">
<p class="image-description">A basic prototype developed in AR Kit for iOS</p></div><div class="project-container-flex-bigger"><p class="project-subtitle">Assessing Technical Solutions & Limitations</p><p>Our first idea was to develop an Augmented Reality (AR) app to recognize physical blocks, while allowing the user to place virtual objects on and around them to build the city.</p><p>However, we discovered that there current AR technology does not support simultaneous tracking of multiple 3D objects. While <b>ARKit</b> allows for extended tracking, it can still only actively track 1 object at a time. Furthermore, it did not have a smooth user experience: recognition took a few seconds and had jitters and lags in movement of the blocks.</p></div></div><div class="project-container-main">   <br /><p>On further research, we came up with a new solution. Since we were building an on-site installation, we had room to control the apparatus and environment of the project. </p></div><div class="project-container-flex"><div class="project-container-flex-bigger"><p>Using copper tapes, we could use customize the blocks such that when a player places them on a touch-screen base, it would recognize the block. This was due to the conductive nature of the tape which would transfer the charge from the user's fingers to the touch-screen. Furthermore, we added unique angular arrangement at the base so that different blocks can be recognized as separate buildings. </p></div><div class="project-container-flex-smaller"><img src="blocks.png" class="full"></div></div><div class="project-container-main"> <p>We developed the game as an interactive game in <b>Unity</b>. We developed a server application which renders a collaborative game-view where players observe the city being virtually constructed &mdash; this allows for a <b>multiplayer experience</b>. I implemented the Unity Low Level API (LLAPI), which uses UDP on the Transport Layer to share information between clients and servers. </p><br /><p class="project-subtitle">Combinations</p><img src="combinations.png" class="full">
<br /><p class="project-subtitle">User Experience Research</p><p><b>How might we make users place the blocks in the way we want them to?</b></p><p>The purpose of this user testing was to uncover how we could guide users to build blocks through our visual design. In our installation, we do not want users to stack the blocks but, instead, have them sprawl across the surface.</p></div><div class="project-container-flex"><div class="project-container-flex-smaller"><img src="map.png" class="full"></div><div class="project-container-flex-bigger"><p><b>The Task</b></p><p>Ask users to ignore the appearance (colour) of the blocks, and tell them the only difference would be the size of each. Then, ask  users to fill one map at a time (in 2 minutes) with blocks according to the visual design of each map. Record the  result, observe the user journey, and gather insights on the decision making.</p></div></div><div class="project-container-main"><p><b>Results</b></p><p>We found that the dotted line works well in terms of indicating where to put the blocks. We found that such a setup had a quicker on-boarding experience for the user and provided a natural understanding of the game's objective.</p><p class="project-subtitle">Cognitive Walkthroughs &amp; Usability Testing</p><p><b> Purpose</b></p><p>To simulate the installation environment and observe how users will interact with the blocks, including their reaction to the virtual world.</p><p><b> Method</b></p><p>We used a projector to project a digital map on a desk as the user interface, and have a display screen as the output of actions. Next, we asked users to start playing with it freely. At the same time, we use a tablet behind the scene to simulate usersâ€™ action in order to make the corresponding reaction on the display screen.</p></div><div class="project-container-flex"><div class="project-container-flex-half"><img src="user-test-2.jpg" class="full shadow"></div><div class="project-container-flex-half"><img src="user-test-1.jpg" class="full shadow"></div></div><div class="project-container-main"> <p><b>Observations</b></p><ul><li>The users saw the transformation of the buildings but had no idea about the rules behind it. <b>Action</b>: Design the appearance of the blocks by different pattern, icon, or colour.</li><li>Some users tried to stack the blocks up while others put the block either horizontally or vertically to see what will happen on big screen. <b>Action: </b>design the appearance of the blocks by different pattern, icon, or colour.</li><li>Most of the users picked one block at a time and put it in a fixed place.</li><li>The users were curious about what will happen if they take out the block they just put on the map. <b>Action</b>: Use a special eraser block to delete buildings.</li></ul></div><div class="project-container-main"> <p class="project-subtitle">Defining a Product-Market Fit</p></div></div></div></section><footer><div class="footer-content">
