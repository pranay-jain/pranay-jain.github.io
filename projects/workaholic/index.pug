                        p People spend almost 5-10 hours per day in front of their screens. This work requires them to be continuously seated for long hours which affects their physical health in terms of eyesight, posture, neck pain, dehydration and headaches. This problem isn't just limited to tech offices; a lot of people now have their daily tasks centered around laptops. 
                        p As a small step towards building a healthy interaction with our devices, Workaholic is a Chrome extension that aims to improve your health and professional life.
                        
                        //- p.project-subtitle Design Challenges
                        //- p There were several applications I came across, each solving a certain problem about these health issues. Some monitored screen time while some provided tips to improve eyesight. However, two things lacked in most products: Firstly, I would have needed five different platforms to see insights about my device usage for all the health concerns I raised. Secondly, I felt such applications need to establish a connection with the user to actually help improve their lifestyle. Measuring screen-time on its own is not motivating and lacks the user interaction required.

                        p Workaholic is a productivity tool in your browser that helps you track your health goals. It comes with a web application that acts as the dashboard to track your health data and see your progress.
                        p The Dashboard takes care of screen time, ergonomic activites, hydration, everyday tasks and note taking. Each of these functions are present as interactive cards where users can enter their data--such as health or notes--and observe its trends over time. The dashboard app can be added as the default New Tab homepage in Chrome.

                        //- <p>There are some obvious challenges that this app needs to overcome to fulfill its goal. Deciding the health activities, understanding the user's daily schedule through an interactive and simple onboarding process, making sure there is a limit to the number of interventions in a day &mdash; to name a few. Additionally, there were some crucial points evaluated during the process.</p>

                        <p>The Health Card provides a visual representation of the user's health goals. We plan to add 3rd party integrations, such as Apple Health to coalesce the user's health data and keep them up to date with their everyday activity goals.

It provides the user with (optional) instructional videos and complete control over the activity such as snoozing and/or increasing their frequency.
