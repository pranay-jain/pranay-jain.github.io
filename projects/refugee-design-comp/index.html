Toronto hosts close to half of the resettled refugees in Canada​<sup>11</sup>,​ and has the highest childcare fees in the country<sup>8</sup>​ ​. While subsidies are provided by the government, they have long waitlists and are often difficult to obtain​<sup>9</sup>.​ Research also shows that the gender employment gap is n​egatively correlated with the access to affordable daycare services​.​
With traditional gender norms requiring women to prioritize childcare and men working, this perpetuates gender segregation in the household and limits educational and vocational opportunities to the women.                        </p><p class="project-subtitle">Reimagining School Spaces</p></div><img class="full shadow" src="birds_eye.png"><div class="project-container-main"><p>This is occurring at a time when cities around the globe are struggling to maintain their timeless structures as they continue their economic growth. 
In Toronto alone, close to 130 schools are facing closure due to underutilization of space. While some buildings are getting too old and are in dire need of repair<sup>1​</sup>, 
nearly 20 percent of schools have enrollment significantly below capacity​<sup>2</sup>.​ Many of these old buildings that have heritage value are in danger of being demolished. Our intervention
proposes to re-purpose these schools that can not only preserve their heritage value, but also provide opportunities for refugees and low-income immigrants to better integrate into their societies. 
The incentive to utilize school spaces​is two-fold. Schools provide the basic infrastructure for educational programs, which allows to keep logistical costs down. Furthermore, schools are perceived as safe spaces<sup>3</sup>​: they
exist in family-safe neighborhoods and provide confidence to parents sending their children.</p><br /></div><img class="full shadow" src="daycare_design.png"><div class="project-container-main"><p>We propose an intervention that creates a ​hybrid space​ that facilitates learning while allowing a sense of security for the parents. The intervention utilizes the classrooms to provide language lessons for parents and 
uses the adjacent space as a r​epurposed daycare​. The daycare is separated from the classroom through a transparent and sound-proof barrier that limits disruption while providing a 
sense of oversight from the parents themselves. This allows parents the peace of mind and be thoroughly involved in the classroom. This intervention targets <strong>UNHCR’s ​SDG 4</strong> t​o ensure 
inclusive and equitable quality education for all​ a​nd​ <strong>SDG 5</strong> ​to achieve gender equality and empower all women.</p></div><img class="full shadow" src="classroom_design.png"><div class="project-container-main">  <p class="project-subtitle">Opportunities for Social Interaction</p></div><img class="full shadow" src="social_space.png"><div class="project-container-main"><p> When planning for such a service-based intervention for a diverse audience, we ought to be realistic. Children of ages 3-7 years require supervision and that can’t be left completely to the parents’ oversight; 
hence, these facilities will also require participation from daycare providers. Volunteerism-based solutions have worked for this in the past, with localites and other refugee parents providing exchange services 
to look after the children​4.​ There are also opportunities to utilize state funding for individual daycare applicants5​ ​ to subsidize these services. This can also create opportunities to involve members of local 
communities like architects, artists and tech enthusiasts to build engaging experiences for children6​ ​ and skill workshops for parents.</p></div><div class="project-container-main"><p><b>This project was submitted as an entry in the <a href="https://citiesandrefugeescomp2019.com/" target="_blank">APRU Cities and Refugees Ideas Competition</a>, which was contested by 90+ teams from over 24 countries worldwide.</b></p>
