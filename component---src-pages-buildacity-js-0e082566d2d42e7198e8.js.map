This\n                  entailed imagining the installation for a particular public\n                  space (such as mall, airport, comic-con event, etc.) and\n                  pitching it as an on-site activation for a client and/or idea\n                  of our choice.\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"project-subtitle\">The Idea</p>\n                <div class=\"quote\">\n                  Bringing the nostalgia of block-stacking to an immersive\n                  mixed-reality experience.{\" \"}\n                </div>\n                <p>\n                  The idea of the project was to create an interactive game that\n                  took real-world interactions of building with blocks and\n                  augment the experience to a virtual space. Each physical block\n                  represents a type of building which, when placed on a game\n                  board, appears as a virtual rendering of that building on\n                  screen. In this way, players can arrange blocks to create a\n                  city of their own. Players are encouraged to collaborate and\n                  build a sustainable city. After they submit their entry, they\n                  can view a 360 model of the city they just created and share\n                  it with others on social media.\n                </p>\n              </div>\n              <div class=\"project-container-main\">\n                <div class=\"video-wrapper\">\n                  <iframe\n                    src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/356494589\"\n                    width=\"640\"\n                    height=\"360\"\n                    frameborder=\"0\"\n                    allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen\"\n                    allowfullscreen\n                  ></iframe>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n              <div class=\"project-container-main\">\n                <p class=\"project-subtitle\">Defining a Product-Market Fit</p>\n                <p>\n                  This project was unique in this sense. Our client was\n                  Thinkingbox, a production studio that works with other clients\n                  on projects. Our expectation from the client was to come up\n                  with an idea for an activation installation that uses new and\n                  exciting technologies. However, we were also expected to come\n                  up with use cases for such an installation: what brands or\n                  IP's it could work for and how it can be scaled.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  To do this, we had to reverse-engineer our idea. Once we came\n                  up with the wild idea after many brainstorming sessions, we\n                  had to roll-back and brainstorm on how this idea is applicable\n                  in the real world. We thought of different industries it could\n                  work with and came up with different applications for it.{\" \"}\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  We pitched it as a possible educational tool to teach{\" \"}\n                  <strong>sustainable urban design</strong>.

We even got in touch with\n                  them to discuss how they measure success for such\n                  installations which helped us further define our goals for the\n                  project.\n                </p>\n              </div>\n              <div class=\"project-container-flex\">\n                <div class=\"project-container-flex-smaller\">\n                  <img src={iPhoneBlackImg} class=\"full\" />\n                  <p class=\"image-description\">\n                    A basic prototype developed in AR Kit for iOS\n                  </p>\n                </div>\n                <div class=\"project-container-flex-bigger\">\n                  <p class=\"project-subtitle\">\n                    Assessing Technical Solutions & Limitations\n                  </p>\n                  <p>\n                    Our first idea was to develop an Augmented Reality (AR) app\n                    to recognize physical blocks, while allowing the user to\n                    place virtual objects on and around them to build the city.\n                  </p>\n                  <p>\n                    However, we discovered that there current AR technology does\n                    not support simultaneous tracking of multiple 3D objects.\n                    While <b>ARKit</b> allows for extended tracking, it can\n                    still only actively track 1 object at a time. Furthermore,\n                    it did not have a smooth user experience: recognition took a\n                    few seconds and had jitters and lags in movement of the\n                    blocks.\n                  </p>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n              <div class=\"project-container-main\">\n                <br />\n                <p>\n                  On further research, we came up with a new solution. Since we\n                  were building an on-site installation, we had room to control\n                  the apparatus and environment of the project. Using copper\n                  tapes, we could use customize the blocks such that when a\n                  player places them on a touch-screen base, it would recognize\n                  the block. Furthermore, we added unique angular arrangement at\n                  the base so that different blocks can be recognized as\n                  separate buildings.{\" \"}\n                </p>\n              </div>\n              <div class=\"project-container-flex\">\n                <div class=\"project-container-flex-smaller\">\n                  <img src={BlocksImg} alt=\"Blocks Image\" class=\"full\" />\n                  <p class=\"image-description\">A glance at the blocks</p>\n                </div>\n                <div class=\"project-container-flex-bigger\">\n                  <img\n                    src={TouchpointImg}\n                    alt=\"Showing how touchpoint technology works\"\n                    class=\"full\"\n                  />\n                </div>\n              </div>\n              <div class=\"project-container-main\">\n                <p>\n                  We developed the concept as an interactive game in{\" \"}\n                  <b>Unity</b>.
