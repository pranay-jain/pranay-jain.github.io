			.main
				.left-content
					.about-header.no-display
						h5 I'm a full-stack web developer and UX designer based in Vancouver, Canada.

					.about-content
						p.no-display I am currently pursuing a dual major in Computer Science and Math at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver. I am a creative developer interested in interaction and user experience design.
						<br />

						p.no-display As a developer, I like to incorporate user-centric design in my projects because I believe design-oriented development helps create better products. I practice minimalism and simplicity in my work and also love experimenting with fonts and typography.
						<br />

						p.no-display I have previously interned at Collabware as a UI/UX Software developer. Collabware builds data-management and collaboration tools for enterprises based on Microsoft Sharepoint. During my internship, I worked on developing the front-end of a new cloud-based software, Collabspace in React.js and Redux. It was a very challenging yet engaging experience for me as it prompted me to take responsibilty of a huge project within a small team and deliver production code on a regular basis. I have also worked as a Javascript developer and UX Designer at UBC Launch Pad.
						<br />

						p.no-display In my free time, I enjoy listening to music and jamming to it on my guitar, working out or watching soccer. I love meeting new people and listening to their stories and ideas. If you'd like to know more about me, or just want to talk, feel free to shoot me a message!
